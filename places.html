                <h1>Jaipur, Rajasthan</h1>
                <p>Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, is called the “Pink City” due to its distinct rose-colored
                    architecture. It’s known for grand forts like Amer Fort, Hawa Mahal’s intricate façade, and bustling
                    bazaars filled with jewelry and handicrafts. Rich in royal history and vibrant culture, Jaipur
                    offers a blend of heritage, architecture, and traditional Rajasthani hospitality.

                <h1>Kerala Backwaters</h1>
                <p >Kerala’s backwaters are a tranquil network of canals, lagoons, and lakes stretching along the Arabian
                    Sea coast. Cruising on a traditional houseboat through palm-lined waters offers a peaceful escape.
                    Alleppey and Kumarakom are popular entry points. The region is also known for its lush greenery,
                    coconut groves, Ayurvedic treatments, and glimpses of authentic village life.
