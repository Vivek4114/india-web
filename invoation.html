                <h1>Unified Payments Interface (UPI)</h1>
                <p id="sec4p" width="60%">
                    Unified Payments Interface (UPI), developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in
                    2016, revolutionized the way Indians make financial transactions. UPI enables instant money
                    transfers between bank accounts using a smartphone, without the need to input bank details. All it
                    requires is a virtual payment address or a QR code. This simple and secure system drastically
                    reduced dependency on cash, especially after the 2016 demonetization. UPI is interoperable across
                    banks and works 24/7, making it highly accessible. With apps like Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, and
                    BHIM using UPI, even small vendors in rural areas began accepting digital payments. By 2024, UPI was
                    processing over 10 billion transactions per month. It not only enhanced financial inclusion in India
                    but also drew international attention, with countries like Singapore, UAE, and France integrating
                    UPI for cross-border transactions. It's a world-class innovation made in India.

                <h1>Aadhaar – Biometric Digital Identity </h1>
                <p width="70%">Aadhaar is the world's largest biometric digital identity system, launched by the
                    Government of India in 2009. It assigns a unique 12-digit number to each citizen, linked with their
                    fingerprints, iris scan, and demographic information. Managed by the Unique Identification Authority
                    of India (UIDAI), Aadhaar covers over 1.3 billion Indians. It serves as a foundational ID that
                    connects people to various government services such as subsidies, pensions, and banking. One of
                    Aadhaar's biggest innovations is its use in enabling Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), which helped
                    eliminate middlemen and reduced corruption. It also allows even the poorest citizens to open bank
                    accounts and access digital services. Aadhaar has been recognized globally for its scale and
                    potential, though it also raised concerns about privacy and data security. Still, it remains a
                    transformative innovation that bridged India’s digital divide and laid the groundwork for many
                    public digital services.

                <h1>Mangalyaan – India’s Mars Mission</h1>
                <p id="sec4p" width="60%">


                    Mangalyaan, officially called the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), was launched by ISRO (Indian Space
                    Research Organisation) on November 5, 2013. It was India's first interplanetary mission and made
                    global headlines when it successfully entered Mars orbit on September 24, 2014 — on its first
                    attempt. What truly set Mangalyaan apart was its incredibly low cost of around $74 million, a
                    fraction of similar missions by NASA or ESA. The mission demonstrated India’s ability to execute
                    high-level space exploration efficiently and economically. Mangalyaan’s main goal was to study Mars'
                    surface, atmosphere, and mineral composition. It also captured stunning images of the Martian
                    surface, contributing valuable data to global scientific communities. ISRO became the first space
                    agency in Asia to reach Mars and the fourth in the world. Mangalyaan was not only a scientific
                    achievement but also a national symbol of India’s growing technological capabilities.

                <h1>Jaipur Foot – Low-Cost Prosthetic Limb </h1>
                <p width="70%">The Jaipur Foot is a revolutionary prosthetic limb developed in India in the 1960s by Dr.
                    P.K. Sethi and artisan Ram Chandra Sharma. Designed to be low-cost, durable, and flexible, it was
                    created specifically for use in rural and rough terrains. Unlike traditional prosthetics that are
                    rigid or expensive, the Jaipur Foot allows amputees to walk, run, squat, and even climb trees —
                    activities essential for daily life in rural India. It costs less than $50 to produce, making it
                    accessible to the poor. Over the years, more than 1.8 million people across India and other
                    developing countries have benefited from this innovation. Organizations like Bhagwan Mahaveer
                    Viklang Sahayata Samiti (BMVSS) have played a major role in distributing it globally. The Jaipur
                    Foot is a prime example of frugal innovation, where simple, affordable technology creates
                    life-changing impact, earning praise from the United Nations and global NGOs.

                <h1>Aravind Eye Care Model – Low-Cost Cataract Surgery</h1>
                <p id="sec4p" width="60%">


                    The Aravind Eye Care System, founded in 1976 by Dr. Govindappa Venkataswamy in Tamil Nadu,
                    revolutionized eye care by making cataract surgery both affordable and high-quality. Aravind
                    developed a unique, assembly-line style model for surgeries, allowing doctors to perform up to 2,000
                    surgeries per year, compared to around 300 in most Western hospitals. Patients are divided into
                    paying and non-paying groups, yet all receive the same quality of care. The revenue from paying
                    patients subsidizes treatment for the poor, ensuring financial sustainability. Aravind also
                    manufactures its own intraocular lenses at a fraction of global prices through Aurolab,
                    significantly cutting surgical costs. This model has helped restore sight to millions and has been
                    replicated in several countries across Asia and Africa. Recognized by Harvard and the World Health
                    Organization, the Aravind model is a brilliant example of how compassion, efficiency, and innovation
                    can transform healthcare.
